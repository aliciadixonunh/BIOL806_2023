I am a Master's student studying under Dr. Bill McDowell at the University of New Hampshire.
I study biogeochemical cycling within freshwater tropical ecosystems.
Specifically, I am interested in the terrestrial-aquatic interface.

Hi it'sa me, Mario (Eric Parker)! I like to research streams and how critical zone structure influences solute flow dynamics in them.
